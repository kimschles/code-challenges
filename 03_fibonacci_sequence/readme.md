# Fibonacci Sequence

## Challenge

Write a function to return a number in the Fibonacci sequence. The input will be the position in the array and the output will be the number in that position.

In the Fibonacci Sequence, [the next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/fibonacci-sequence.html).

For Example:

* The 2 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+1)
* The 3 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+2),
* And the 5 is (2+3)

Sequence:
`1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...`

### Sample Input & Output

`3 => 2`

`6 => 8`

`14 => 377`
